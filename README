GETTING STARTED

Eat a hearty breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day!


PACKAGES

Packages come in two flavors: "dev" and "min". The "dev" packages are intended 
for development, and have comments and debugging code. The "min" packages have
the same code, but with comments and debugging information stripped out and
symbols crushed. They are intended for use in production -- ha ha ha!
